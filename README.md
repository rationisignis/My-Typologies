# My-Typologies
This repository provides a detailed breakdown of various personality typology systems, each rooted in different psychological theories and frameworks. The purpose of this compilation is to give a comprehensive understanding of how personality is categorized, measured, and analyzed across several prominent models. Not only do these systems offer unique insights into human behavior, cognition, and social interactions, but I’ve also explored these systems personally to dive into the nuances of my own thought processes and behaviors.

## Typologies Covered:
MBTI (Myers-Briggs Type Indicator): A Neo-Jungian personality theory that classifies individuals into 16 types based on four preference pairs: Extraversion/Introversion, Sensing/Intuition, Thinking/Feeling, and Judging/Perceiving.

Socionics: Developed by Aušra Augustinavičiūtė, this theory builds upon Jung’s ideas and Antoni Kępiński’s Information Metabolism theory. It categorizes people into 16 types, highlighting strengths, weaknesses, and how individuals process and exchange information in the environment.

Classic Jungian: Based on Carl Jung's foundational work in Psychological Types, this system identifies eight personality types through a combination of Extraversion/Introversion and four cognitive functions: Sensing/Intuition and Thinking/Feeling.

Enneagram: A framework derived from ancient wisdom traditions, created by Oscar Ichazo. It distinguishes nine personality types, each representing an essential quality of human experience, as well as how these qualities are distorted by the ego.

Psychosophy: A typology that emphasizes four aspects of life: Volition (Will), Emotions, Logic, and Physics. It explores how individuals relate to the world based on their attitudes towards these aspects, and how they influence behavior and social interactions.

The Big Five Personality Test: The most widely accepted personality model in academic psychology. It identifies five major personality traits: Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism, providing a comprehensive and independent evaluation of personality.
